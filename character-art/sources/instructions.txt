1. Your image should have a black or solid color background
2. Go to http://www.text-image.com

4. Set the font size to "smallest" (althouth that doesn't matter I think)
5. Set the image width to 130
6. Set the background to "black"

8. Click convert

If you want your freshly generated character art to be picked up by the character art selector, it has to be in the /character-art/ folder and you have to add its filename (without the extension) to the array called ARTWORKS in /scripts/character-art.js
